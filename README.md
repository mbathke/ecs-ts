# Entity Component System (ECS) for Javascript

This software is a work in progress and currently in a very early stage. It's very far from usable, yet.

## Installation and Build

Clone the repository with `git clone` and then just install the node modules:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Cleanup the latest build

The cleanup is also done automatically when building the application.

```bash
$ npm run clean
```
